# DVLDE-simple

This is a simplification for DVLDE in which we are only interested in the manifold features,
not the original domain. For this reason, our latent variables are:
- features (?) - if extracted.
- time_encoding
- y_0

The observables will be the ys in the manifold. More particularly the distances to their neighbors.
